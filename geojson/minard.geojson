Between 1847 and 1874 an estimated 140,000 indentured workers signed up from the Chinese coastal provinces of Xiamen (then called Amoy) and Guangdong to work in Cuba. The Chinese were contractually obliged to work for eight years, at which point it was the land owners’ right to impose another eight years of work. Cuban law enforced the indentured contracts, wages were very low and working conditions were often very poor."},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[91.44234,-200.730442],[105.269411,-199.768879],[123.381714,-202.425937],[134.21701,-206.336254],[214.903576,-263.584852],[222.943714,-272.379967],[243.326977,-319.754707],[262.97095,-359.80943],[272.312359,-368.954742],[284.625,-378.05299],[312.407041,-386.039988],[332.109398,-379.845257],[351.216331,-369.782009],[387.862564,-351.79331],[462.683281,-315.217823],[472.434807,-305.13633],[478.2911,-293.803967],[483.164291,-281.897821],[487.030678,-269.302186],[506.50297,-220.548517],[509.435837,-220.090458],[491.735214,-262.911873],[481.988792,-291.235516],[474.987038,-306.248409],[466.814575,-315.031178],[454.734482,-323.120651],[323.734555,-386.032755],[311.584915,-388.536327],[291.198711,-382.79509],[274.177522,-373.590526],[257.098661,-355.643711],[252.687531,-344.687672],[246.343436,-334.596546],[233.733749,-302.921192],[227.230637,-288.189793],[224.43824,-280.145992],[218.900368,-271.37524],[212.106308,-264.461277],[137.10284,-212.367844],[126.376724,-206.52243],[115.758888,-203.401253],[106.083939,-202.241222],[97.571388,-202.775673],[91.44234,-200.730442]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"text":"After the discovery of gold in California, twenty-five to forty thousand migrants from France traveled there in the 1850s.
