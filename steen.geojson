Tools which can be used to practice drawing, or which can be used as models to paint, festoon the studio. For example, a plaster putto (a small cherub) hangs from the ceiling. Putti frequently appear in religious and mythological paintings. In Baroque art a putto might be used to represent the omnipresence of God. A putto might also be used to represent a cupid. In classical mythology, Cupid is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. In paintings a cupid is often depicted shooting an arrow (of desire)."},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[101.610624,-50.326885],[130.049918,-24.776735],[145.335844,-33.300519],[134.798018,-55.111739],[115.547242,-66.950834],[101.610624,-50.326885]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"text":"The statuette may allude to the ox of St Luke, who is the patron saint of artists. In traditional paintings Saint Luke is often accompanied by an ox or bull. An ox or cow could also be symbolic of hard work.

A plaster cow or an ox would therefore be very useful study material for the artist and his students.\n\n"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[34.895878,-65.599263],[34.63558,-50.78512],[47.375464,-49.996666],[55.10578,-56.887518],[59.757345,-59.225572],[61.153459,-66.617711],[34.895878,-65.599263]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"text":"In the bottom right corner of the painting are a number of objects which you could imagine the painter and his students using in a still life. Vanitas still lifes were a common genre in Dutch art of the 16th and 17th centuries. A vanitas is a symbolic work of art which depicts the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. Vanitas paintings often contrast symbols of wealth (such as a fur muff, a musical instrument and a bottle of wine) with symbols of ephemerality and death (such as a skull)."},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[206.249584,-180.921309],[206.136486,-251.967553],[104.10371,-252.758484],[105.547907,-228.890105],[136.25793,-224.742336],[141.988158,-209.182298],[206.249584,-180.921309]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"text":"In the bottom left hand corner of the painting is a silk cloak or drape, a book and a chest.

However it is unlikely that the students depicted in The Drawing Lesson are the master's apprentices. The rich colors of the girl's clothes suggest she is no painter's apprentice.
