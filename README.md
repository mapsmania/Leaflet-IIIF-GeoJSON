Leaflet IIIF GeoJSON

This is an interactive map which you can use to add annotations
to an IIIF manifest.

To add your own IIIF manifest to the map open the app.js file and
add the URL of your manifest to the manifesturl variable -

"var manifestUrl = yourURL"

When you preview the map you can then use the drawing tools provided
to select and highlight regions on your image.

When finished simply click the 'Export GeoJSON' button to download
a GeoJSON file of your added selections.
